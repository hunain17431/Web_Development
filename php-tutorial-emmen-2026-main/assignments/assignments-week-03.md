# PHP Programming - Functions

This weeks assignments are about writing functions. 

## Write the 'explode()' and 'join()' or 'implode()' functions

In PHP there are two functions to either split or join an array

* `join()` / `implode()`: [php](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.implode.php)
* explode(): [php](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.explode.php)

Write these two functions yourself, using only the simplest form: a separator and an array.

## Assignment 2 - your diet 

Implement the following

Write a function that returns a list of nutrients in an HTML table format. The list should be styled using CSS.

The function takes 5 parameters of which the first 4 are numbers: Calories, Carbs, Protein and Fat. The last parameter
is a Boolean (TRUE or FALSE). Based on the Boolean the final input of the list should say if it fits your diet (Diet
approved/disapproved).

## Assignment 3 - Video parental checks

Implement the following

A customer has asked you to create an function that will automatically index registrations for his video store website.
The following conditions must be incorporated into the application. Based on several factors, a message will be built
and returned to the customer.

1. If the user is under 18, the message will contain a warning saying the user is not old enough to register.
2. When the user is a woman, the message will inform the user about an upcoming ladies night event in the video store.
3. If the user has recently visited the website, the message will say that a discount will be applied during checkout.
4. When all three of the conditions stated before have been met, instead of a message the user will see a big red
   WARNING!!!.

Because of the testing phase the website is in, it is sufficient to show simple messages on the screen (echo). When
several conditions are correct, please show all messages. When condition 4 is correct, please show only this message.
